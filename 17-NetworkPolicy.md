# Chapter 17: Kubernetes Network Policies

**Key Objectives:**
- Clearly understand Kubernetes Network Policies.
- Secure and isolate pod-to-pod and external communication.
- Learn to write and manage network policies practically.
- Troubleshoot common network-policy issues with confidence.
- Master network policy concepts through multiple hands-on scenarios.

---

## 1. Introduction to Network Policies

Kubernetes **Network Policies** enable you to define how pods communicate with each other and with external networks.  

**Why Use Network Policies?**
- Enforce security policies at the pod level.
- Isolate sensitive workloads.
- Achieve compliance and reduce risk.

---

## 2. Network Policy Components

A network policy consists of:

- **podSelector**: Identifies target pods.
- **policyTypes**: Defines policy as `Ingress`, `Egress`, or both.
- **ingress/egress**: Specifies allowed traffic sources/destinations.

### Minimal YAML Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

- An empty `{}` selector targets **all pods**.

---

## 3. Default Behavior & Isolation

By default, Kubernetes allows all pod-to-pod communication within and across namespaces.

- Applying a restrictive policy isolates pods immediately.
- Isolation applies only within the namespace the policy is deployed.

---

## 4. Hands-on Examples

### Example 1: Deny All Traffic

Isolate all pods (deny ingress and egress traffic):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-traffic
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

---

## 4. Allow Specific Pod-to-Pod Communication

Allow pods labeled `app=frontend` to access pods labeled `app=backend`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-backend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

---

## 5. Allow Communication from Specific Namespace

Allow pods from namespace `frontend` to access pods in namespace `backend`.

Label the namespace first:
```bash
kubectl label namespace frontend team=web
```

Apply policy in backend namespace:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-namespace
  namespace: backend
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          team: web
```

---

## 6. Egress Traffic Restriction to External CIDR

Allow pods labeled `app=api` only to reach external networks on port `443` (HTTPS):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-egress-https-only
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
```

---

## 7. Allow DNS Resolution (Egress Policy)

If using restrictive egress policies, DNS must explicitly be allowed:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-dns
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
```

---

## 8. Advanced Example: Combining Ingress and Egress

Allow frontend pods to talk to backend pods, and allow backend pods external DB access:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: frontend-backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                                | Resolution Steps                              |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Pod communication blocked            | Verify pod selectors & namespace selectors. |
| Pod cannot reach external DNS/internet| Add DNS or external IP explicitly to egress rules. |
| Overly restrictive policies          | Temporarily remove policies, test, then reapply incrementally.|

Check quickly with commands:
```bash
kubectl get netpol
kubectl describe netpol <policy>
kubectl get pods -o wide --show-labels
```

---

## 11. Best Practices for Network Policies

- **Start restrictive:** Deny all and explicitly allow.
- **Label clearly:** Use descriptive pod and namespace labels.
- **Keep rules simple:** Easier to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and test your rules.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Apply policy YAML          | `kubectl apply -f policy.yaml`                  |
| List network policies      | `kubectl get networkpolicy -A`                  |
| Check policy details       | `kubectl describe networkpolicy <name>`         |
